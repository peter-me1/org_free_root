the new fastest growing java interface library for you and us

just download the source folder and add it to an eclipse project to see what it can do for you.
If it gets the size i expect then great things will be possible in near future.
Think for what wikipedia , google and the internet has already done for us.

The package name "ji" stands for "java interface library"
